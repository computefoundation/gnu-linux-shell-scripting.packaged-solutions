'   ...more urls...
' 
' Aliases:
' 
'   Aliases are defined with a vertical bar ("|") before or after them, used
'   also to separate and define multiple aliases for one or more URLs.
' 
' {search\D} placeholder:
' 
'   URLs requiring a search query may contain a {search\D} placeholder in its
'   place, where D is the URL's space delimiter. It will be replaced by the
'   search query passed to webutil.
'       E.g. webutil "stores-all" "outdoor gear"
'       # Opens all URLs aliased by "stores-all" and replaces each of their
'       # {search\D} placeholders with "outdoorDgear".
' 
'   A URL may contain multiple {search\D} placeholders to allow multiple search
'   queries (e.g. start and end locations for travel directions) or to copy them
'   within itself. The search query used by each placeholder corresponds to its
'   position in the URL. If a search query for a placeholder does not exist, the
'   placeholder will be replaced with an empty string. (See webutil's
'   help documentation for information on passing in multiple search queries).
' 
'   Placeholder options can be used to change and modify the search query used
'   by a placeholder. They are specified with a bang ("!") and placed right
'   before the delimiter specifier. They are the following:
' 
'     !<N>:    Use search query N (e.g. {search!3\D})
'     !W<P>:   Use word at position P of the search query only; will work for
'              multiple words (e.g. {search!W2!W5!W6\+})
'     !U[P]:   Make all letters of word at position P of the search query
'              uppercase (e.g. {search!U1!U3\+}); omit P for all words
'     !C:      Capitalize all words in the search query
'     !R:      Reverse all words in the search query
'     !M:      Remove all commas in the search query
' 
'   Unsafe characters in a URL will be encoded and can be escaped with two
'   backslashes to not be (this also applies for search queries passed to
'   webutil).
' 
'   Instructions on adding a new URL with a {search\D} placeholder are at the
'   bottom of this file.
' 
' Configuration options:
' 
'   Options can be used to configure how one or more URLs are opened. They can
'   be placed after the last alias on an alias line to apply to multiple URLs,
'   or after an individual URL. They are the following:
' 
'   %browser=VALUE:  Browser to use; possible values are "gui<1-9>" (for
'                    graphical browsers) and "term<1-7>" (for terminal
'                    browsers). (Browsers are defined in webutil under "User
'                    configurations"; default is GUI 1).
' 
'   %dump[+NUM_PAGES]:  Dump the output of each URL to a terminal window (using
'                       terminal browser 1 by default). Optionally, jump forward
'                       the given number of pages. (The letter "p" may be
'                       appended to NUM_PAGES for readability).
' 
'   Each URL configuration option will override the corresponding one for its
'   alias.

'      Foursquare.com requires two search queries like other business locator
'      websites: business and location, however, they appear in the opposite
'      order. As a result, they are switched with the "!<P>" option.
'      Furthermore, the words for the location search query placeholder are
'      capitalized with option "!C". To illustrate how the URL is parsed, it
'      will be the following if opened with search queries "flea market" and
'      "seattle, wa":
'          https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=Seattle%2C%20WA&q=flea%20market

' 
' Instructions on adding a new URL with a {search\D} placeholder:
' 
'   1. Go to the search page for the URL of interest.
'   2. Search for something using at least two search words (space separated).
'   3. Copy and paste the new loaded URL (from the browser's URL bar) to this
'      file under an alias.
'   4. Find the search words in the URL and make note of the character(s) used
'      as their delimiter.
'   5. Replace the search words with "{search\D}", where D is the delimiter.
' 
' Helpful notes/tips:
' 
'   Search query not appearing in URL:
'     This means the website sends them using the request's body, form fields or
'     another method. Webutil does not modify requests so the {search\D}
'     placeholder cannot be used with the URL.
' 
'   URL is very long (e.g. contains a long key of random letters and numbers):
'     A URL may possibly be shortened by removing some query parameters
'     from it. Query parameters are separated by an ampersand ("&"). This could
'     cause the URL to break however so it should be tested if altered.

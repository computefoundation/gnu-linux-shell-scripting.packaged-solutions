' 
' Aliases:
' 
'   Aliases are defined with a vertical bar ("|") before or after them, which is
'   also used to separate and define multiple aliases for one or more URLs.
' 
' {search\D} placeholder:
' 
'   URLs requiring a search query can contain a {search\D} placeholder (where D 
'   is the URL's space delimiter) in its place to have it be replaced by the
'   search query passed to webutil.
'       E.g. webutil "stores" "specialty hardware"
'       # Opens all URLs aliased by "stores" and replaces each of their
'       # {search\D} placeholders with "specialtyDhardware".
'   (See webutil's help documentation for information on passing in multiple
'   search queries).
' 
'   A URL may contain up to eight {search\D} placeholders to allow multiple
'   search queries (e.g. start and end locations for travel directions) or to
'   copy them within itself. The search query used by each placeholder
'   corresponds to its position in the URL by default. If a search query for
'   a placeholder does not exist, the placeholder will be replaced with an empty
'   string.
' 
'   Placeholder options can be used to change and modify the search query used
'   by a placeholder. They are specified with a bang ("!") and placed right
'   before the delimiter specifier. They are the following:
' 
'     !<P>:    Use search query at position P in arguments (e.g. {search!3\D})
'     !W<P>:   Use only word at position P in the search query; will work for
'              multiple words (e.g. {search!W2!W5!W6\+})
'     !U[P]:   Make word at position P (or all words if P is omitted) in the
'              search query upper case (e.g. {search!U1!U3\+});
'     !C:      Capitalize all words in the search query
'     !R:      Reverse all words in the search query
'     !M:      Remove all commas in the search query
' 
'   Unsafe characters in a URL will be encoded and can be escaped with two
'   backslashes to not be (this also applies for search queries passed to
'   webutil).
' 
'   Instructions on adding a new URL with a {search\D} placeholder are at the
'   bottom of this file.
' 
' Configuration options:
' 
'   Options can be used to configure how one or more URLs are opened. They can
'   be placed after the last alias on an alias line to apply to multiple URLs,
'   or after an individual URL. They are the following:
' 
'   %browser=VALUE:  Browser to use; possible values are "gui<1-5>" (for
'                    graphical browsers) and "term<1-3>" (for terminal
'                    browsers). (Browsers are defined in webutil under "User
'                    configurations"; default is GUI 1).
' 
'   %dump[+NUM_PAGES]:  Dump the output of each URL to a terminal window (using
'                       terminal browser 1 by default). Optionally, jump forward
'                       the given number of pages. (The letter "p" may be
'                       appended to NUM_PAGES for readability).
' 
'   Each URL configuration option will override the corresponding one for its
'   alias.
' 
' Examples:
' 
'   Many of the examples below have a comment beginning with "Ex." for
'   explanation.

'      Foursquare.com requires two search queries like other business locator
'      websites: business and location. They are, however, in the opposite order
'      order and as a result, switched with the "!<P>" option. Furthermore, the
'      words for the location search query placeholder are capitalized with
'      option "!C". To illustrate how the URL is parsed, it will be the
'      following if opened with search queries "flea market" and
'      "seattle, wa":
'      https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=Seattle%2C%20WA&q=flea%20market
https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near={search!2!C\%20}&q={search!1\%20}
'      Judysbook.com also uses placeholder options to change and format its
'      search queries. Additionally, they appear in the URL twice, requiring two
'      two additional placeholders. Since these additionaly placeholders will
'      use the third and fourth search queries by default, they specify the
'      "!<P>" option to use the first and second, respectively. To illustrate
'      how the URL is parsed, it will be the following if opened with search
'      queries "flea market" and "seattle, wa":
'      https://www.judysbook.com/searchresult/Seattle/WA/p1/s0/t0?q=flea+market

' 
' Instructions on adding a new URL with a {search\D} placeholder:
' 
'   1. Go to the search page for the URL of interest.
'   2. Search for something using at least two search words (space separated).
'   3. Copy and paste the new loaded URL (from the browser's URL bar) to this
'      file under an alias.
'   4. Find the search words in the URL and make note of the character(s) used
'      as their delimiter.
'   5. Replace the search words with "{search\D}", where D is the delimiter.
' 
' Helpful notes/tips:
' 
'   Insufficient placeholder options:
'     The current placeholder options were created based on use cases for the
'     examples above. If others are need, please send an email to
'     linux_user_base@yahoo.com with the request, however, only the most
'     commonly asked for options will be added. If needing to add other options
'     right away, please see and change the source code in
'     url-search-placeholder-parser.pl. The code for placeholder options start
'     around the middle of the file.
' 
'   Search query not appearing in URL:
'     This means the website sends them using the request's body, form fields or
'     another method. Webutil does not modify requests so the {search\D}
'     placeholder cannot be used with the URL.
' 
'   URL is very long (e.g. contains a long key of random letters and numbers):
'     A URL may possibly be shortened by removing some query parameters
'     from it. Query parameters are separated by an ampersand ("&"). This could
'     cause the URL to break however so it should be tested if altered.

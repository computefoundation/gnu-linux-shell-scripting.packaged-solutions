' Aliases and URLs:
' 
'   Aliases for one or more URLs are defined on a single line and identified and
'   separated by a vertical bar ("|"). Each aliased URL is placed on its own
'   line under the alias line.
' 
' URL search query placeholder:
' 
'   A URL with a search query section may use a {search\D} placeholder, where D
'   is the URL's space delimiter, to be replaced by a search query passed to
'   openurl.
' 
'     Example:
'       openurl "stores-all" "outdoor gear"
'         # opens all URLs aliased by "stores-all" and replaces each of their
'         # {search\D} placeholders with "outdoorDgear"
' 
'   A URL may contain multiple {search\D} placeholders to use multiple search
'   queries (e.g. start and end locations for travel directions) or to copy them
'   within itself. The search query used by a placeholder corresponds to the
'   placeholder's position in the URL. If one's search query does not exist, it
'   will be replaced with an empty string. (See openurl's help documentation
'   for information on passing in multiple search queries).
' 
'   Placeholder options can be used to change and modify the search query used
'   by a placeholder. They are specified with a bang ("!") and placed right
'   before the delimiter specifier. They are the following:
' 
'     !<N>:    Use search query N (e.g. {search!3\D})
'     !W<P>:   Use word at position P of the search query only; will work for
'              multiple words (e.g. {search!W2!W5!W6\+})
'     !U[P]:   Make all letters of word at position P of the search query
'              uppercase (e.g. {search!U1!U3\+}); omit P for all words
'     !C:      Capitalize all words in the search query
'     !R:      Reverse all words in the search query
'     !M:      Remove all commas in the search query
' 
'   Unsafe URL characters in a URL will be encoded. An unsafe URL character can
'   be escaped with two backslashes to keep it from being encoded. This also
'   applies to the delimiter in the search placeholder and the search queries
'   passed to openurl.
' 
'   Instructions on adding a new URL with a {search\D} placeholder are at the
'   bottom of this file.
' 
' Configuration options:
' 
'   Options can be used to configure how one or more URLs are opened. They are
'   placed after the last alias on an alias line to apply all aliased URLS or
'   or an individual URL to apply only to the individual URL. They are the
'   following:
' 
'        %browser=VALUE:  Browser to use; possible values are "gui<1-9>" (for
'                         graphical browsers) and "term<1-7>" (for terminal
'                         browsers). Browsers are defined in section
'                         Configurations of open url; the default is GUI 1.
' 
'     %dump[+NUM_PAGES]:  Dump the output of each URL to a terminal window
'                         (using terminal browser 1 by default). Optionally,
'                         jump forward the given number of pages. (The letter
'                         "p" may be appended to NUM_PAGES for readability).
' 
'   A configuration specified for a URL will override the same configuration
'   specified for an alias.
'

' 
'   Many of the examples below have a comment above them marked by "Ex." for
'   explanation.

'      Foursquare.com requires two search queries like other business locator
'      websites: business and location, however, they appear in the opposite
'      order. As a result, they are switched with the "!<P>" option.
'      Furthermore, the words for the location search query placeholder are
'      capitalized with option "!C". To illustrate how the URL is parsed, it
'      will be the following if opened with search queries "flea market" and
'      "seattle, wa":
'          https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=Seattle%2C%20WA&q=flea%20market

' 
' Instructions on adding a new URL with a {search\D} placeholder:
' 
'   1. Go to the search page for the URL of interest.
'   2. Search for something using at least two (space separated) search words.
'   3. Copy and paste the loaded URL (in the browser's URL bar) to this file
'      under an alias.
'   4. Find the search words in the URL and make note of the character(s) used
'      as their space delimiter.
'   5. Replace the search words with "{search\D}", where D is the space
'      delimiter.
' 
' Helpful notes/tips:
' 
'   Search query not appearing in URL:
'     This means the website sends them using the request's body, form fields or
'     another method. In this case, the {search\D} placeholder cannot be used
'     with the URL.
' 
'   URL is very long (e.g. contains a long key of random letters and numbers):
'     A URL may possibly be shortened by removing some query parameters
'     from it. Query parameters are separated by an ampersand ("&"). This could
'     cause the URL to break however so it should be tested if altered.
